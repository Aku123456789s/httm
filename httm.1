.SH NAME
httm \- manual page for httm 0.9.4
.SH DESCRIPTION
httm 0.9.4
.PP
By default, httm will display non\-interactive information about unique file versions contained on
ZFS snapshots.
.PP
You may also select from the various interactive modes below to browse for, select, and/or restore
files.
.SS "USAGE:"
.IP
httm [OPTIONS] [INPUT_FILES]...
.SS "ARGS:"
.TP
<INPUT_FILES>...
in the default, non\-interactive mode, put requested files here.  If you
enter no files, then httm will pause waiting for input on stdin(3).  In
any interactive mode, this is the directory search path. If no directory
is entered, httm will use the current working directory.
.SS "OPTIONS:"
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-interactive\fR
interactively browse and search files.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-select\fR
interactively browse and search files.  Continue to another
dialog to select a snapshot version.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-restore\fR
interactively browse and search files.  Continue to another
dialog to select a snapshot version to restore.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-deleted\fR <DELETED>
show deleted files in interactive modes, or do a search for all
such files, if a directory is specified. If \fB\-\-deleted\fR=\fI\,only\/\fR is
specified, then, in interactive modes, non\-deleted files will
be excluded from the search.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-alt\-replicated\fR
automatically discover an alternative locally replicated
dataset and list its snapshots as well.  NOTE: Make certain any
replicated dataset is mounted before use, as httm will silently
ignore any unmounted datasets in the interactive modes.
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-recursive\fR
recurse into selected directory to find more files. Only
available in interactive and deleted file modes.
.TP
\fB\-\-snap\-point\fR <SNAP_POINT>
ordinarily httm will automatically choose your most local
snapshot directory, but here you may manually specify your own
mount point for that directory, such as the mount point for a
remote share.  You can also set via the environment variable
HTTM_SNAP_POINT.
.TP
\fB\-\-local\-dir\fR <LOCAL_DIR>
used with SNAP_POINT to determine where the corresponding live
root of the ZFS snapshot dataset is.  If not set, httm defaults
to your current working directory.  You can also set via the
environment variable HTTM_LOCAL_DIR.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
display the backup locations only, without extraneous
information, delimited by a NEWLINE.
.TP
\fB\-0\fR, \fB\-\-zero\fR
display the backup locations only, without extraneous
information, delimited by a NULL CHARACTER.
.TP
\fB\-\-not\-so\-pretty\fR
display the ordinary output, but tab delimited, without any
pretty border lines.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-live\fR
only display information concerning snapshot versions, and no
\&'live' versions of files or directories.
.TP
\fB\-\-install\-zsh\-hot\-keys\fR
install zsh hot keys to the users home directory, and then exit
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
