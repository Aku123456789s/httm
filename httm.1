.SH NAME
httm \- manual page for httm 0.11.9
.SH DESCRIPTION
httm 0.11.9
.PP
by default, httm will display non\-interactive information about unique file versions contained on
snapshots.
.PP
You may also select from the various interactive modes below to browse for, select, and/or restore
files.
.SS "USAGE:"
.IP
httm [OPTIONS] [INPUT_FILES]...
.SS "ARGS:"
.TP
<INPUT_FILES>...
in any non\-interactive mode, put requested files here.  If you enter no
files, then httm will pause waiting for input on stdin(3). In any
interactive mode, this is the directory search path. If no directory is
entered, httm will use the current working directory.
.SS "OPTIONS:"
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-interactive\fR
interactive browse and search a specified directory to display
unique file versions.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-select\fR
interactive browse and search a specified directory to display
unique file versions.  Continue to another dialog to select a
snapshot version to dump to stdout(3).
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-restore\fR
interactive browse and search a specified directory to display
unique file versions.  Continue to another dialog to select a
snapshot version to restore.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-deleted\fR <DELETED>
show deleted files in interactive modes.  In non\-interactive
modes, do a search for all files deleted from a specified
directory. If "\-\-deleted only" is specified, then, in
interactive modes, non\-deleted files will be excluded from the
search. If "\-\-deleted single" is specified, then, deleted files
behind deleted directories, (files with a depth greater than
one) will be ignored. [possible values: all, single, only]
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-alt\-replicated\fR
automatically discover locally replicated datasets and list
their snapshots as well.  NOTE: Be certain such replicated
datasets are mounted before use, as httm will silently ignore
any unmounted datasets in the interactive modes.
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-recursive\fR
recurse into selected directory to find more files. Only
available in interactive and deleted file modes.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-exact\fR
use exact pattern matching for searches in the interactive
modes (in contrast to the default fuzzy\-finder searching).
.TP
\fB\-\-snap\-point\fR <SNAP_POINT>
ordinarily httm will automatically choose your dataset root
directory (the most proximate ancestor directory which contains
a ".zfs" directory), but here you may manually specify that
mount point for ZFS (directory which contains a ".zfs"
directory) or btrfs\-snapper (directory which contains a
".snapshots" directory), such as the local mount point for a
remote share.  You may also set via the HTTM_SNAP_POINT
environment variable.  Note: Use of both "snap\-point" and
"local\-dir" are not always necessary to view versions on remote
shares.  httm can also automatically detect ZFS and
btrfs\-snapper datasets mounted as AFP, SMB, and NFS remote
shares.
.TP
\fB\-\-local\-dir\fR <LOCAL_DIR>
used with "snap\-point" to determine where the corresponding
live root filesystem of the dataset is.  Put more simply, the
"local\-dir" is the directory you backup to your "snap\-point".
If not set, httm defaults to your current working directory.
You can also set via the environment variable HTTM_LOCAL_DIR.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
display the backup locations only, without extraneous
information, delimited by a NEWLINE.
.TP
\fB\-0\fR, \fB\-\-zero\fR
display the backup locations only, without extraneous
information, delimited by a NULL CHARACTER.
.TP
\fB\-\-not\-so\-pretty\fR
display the ordinary output, but tab delimited, without any
pretty border lines.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-live\fR
only display information concerning snapshot versions, and no
\&'live' versions of files or directories.
.TP
\fB\-\-install\-zsh\-hot\-keys\fR
install zsh hot keys to the users home directory, and then exit
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print help information
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information
