.SH NAME
httm \- manual page for httm 0.15.13
.SH DESCRIPTION
httm 0.15.13
httm prints the size, date and corresponding locations of available unique versions of files
residing on snapshots.  May also be used interactively to select and restore from such versions, and
even to snapshot datasets which contain certain files.
.SS "USAGE:"
.IP
httm [OPTIONS] [\-\-] [INPUT_FILES]...
.SS "ARGS:"
.TP
<INPUT_FILES>...
in any non\-interactive mode, put requested files here.  If you enter no
files, then httm will pause waiting for input on stdin(3). In any
interactive mode, this is the directory search path. If no directory is
entered, httm will use the current working directory.
.SS "OPTIONS:"
.HP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-browse\fR
.IP
interactive browse and search a specified directory to display unique file versions.
[aliases: interactive]
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-select\fR
.IP
interactive browse and search a specified directory to display unique file versions.
Continue to another dialog to select a snapshot version to dump to stdout(3).
.HP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-restore[=\fR<RESTORE>...]
.IP
interactive browse and search a specified directory to display unique file versions.
Continue to another dialog to select a snapshot version to restore.  Default is a
non\-destructive "copy" to the current working directory with a new name, so as not to
overwrite any "live" file version.  However, user may specify "overwrite" to restore to
the same file location. [possible values: copy, overwrite, yolo]
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-deleted[=\fR<DELETED_MODE>...]
.TP
show deleted files in interactive modes.
In non\-interactive modes, do a search for all
.IP
files deleted from a specified directory. If "\-\-deleted only" is specified, then, in
interactive modes, non\-deleted files will be excluded from the search. If "\-\-deleted
single" is specified, then, deleted files behind deleted directories, (files with a
depth greater than one) will be ignored. [possible values: all, single, only]
.HP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-alt\-replicated\fR
.IP
automatically discover locally replicated datasets and list their snapshots as well.
NOTE: Be certain such replicated datasets are mounted before use.  httm will silently
ignore unmounted datasets in the interactive modes.
.HP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-recursive\fR
.IP
recurse into the selected directory to find more files. Only available in interactive
and deleted file modes.
.HP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-exact\fR
.IP
use exact pattern matching for searches in the interactive modes (in contrast to the
default fuzzy\-finder searching).
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-snap\fR
.IP
snapshot the mount point/s of the dataset/s which contains the input file/s. Note: This
is a ZFS only option. [aliases: snap\-file, snapshot, snap\-file\-mount]
.HP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-mount\-for\-file\fR
.IP
display the mount point/s of the dataset/s which contains the input file/s. [aliases:
mount]
.HP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-last\-snap\fR
.IP
automatically select and print the path of last\-in\-time unique snapshot version for the
input file.
.HP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
.IP
display the snapshot locations only, without extraneous information, delimited by a
NEWLINE character. [aliases: newline]
.HP
\fB\-0\fR, \fB\-\-zero\fR
.IP
display the snapshot locations only, without extraneous information, delimited by a NULL
character.
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-filter\fR
.IP
by default, in the interactive modes, httm will filter out results from non\-supported
datasets (like ext4, tmpfs, procfs, sysfs, or devtmpfs), and in common snapshot paths.
Here, one may select to disable such filtering.  httm, however, should always show the
input path, and results from behind any input path when that path is searched.
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-traverse\fR
.TP
in recursive mode, don't traverse symlinks.
Although httm does its best to prevent
.IP
searching pathologically recursive symlink\-ed paths, it may still be possible to exhaust
memory by searching certain paths.  Here, you may disable symlink traversal completely.
NOTE: httm will never traverse symlinks when a requested recursive search is on the
root/base directory.
.HP
\fB\-\-not\-so\-pretty\fR
.IP
display the ordinary output, but tab delimited, without any pretty border lines.
[aliases: tabs, plain\-jane]
.HP
\fB\-\-omit\-ditto\fR
.IP
omit display of the snapshot version which may be identical to the live version (`httm`
ordinarily displays *all* snapshot versions and the live version).
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-live\fR
.IP
only display information concerning snapshot versions (display no information regarding
\&'live' versions of files or directories). [aliases: dead, disco]
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-snap\fR
.IP
only display information concerning 'pseudo\-live' versions in Display Recursive mode (in
\fB\-\-deleted\fR, \fB\-\-recursive\fR, but non\-interactive modes).  Useful for finding only the "files
that once were" and displaying only those pseudo\-live/undead files. [aliases: undead,
zombie]
.HP
\fB\-\-map\-aliases\fR <MAP_ALIASES>
.IP
manually map a local directory (eg. "/Users/<User Name>") as an alias of a mount point
for ZFS or btrfs, such as the local mount point for a backup on a remote share (eg.
"/Volumes/Home").  This option is useful if you wish to view snapshot versions from
within the local directory you back up to your remote share.  Such map is delimited by a
colon, ':', and specified as <LOCAL_DIR>:<REMOTE_DIR> (eg. \fB\-\-map\-aliases\fR /Users/<User
Name>:/Volumes/Home).  Multiple maps may be specified delimited by a comma, ','.  You
may also set via the environment variable HTTM_MAP_ALIASES. [aliases: aliases]
.HP
\fB\-\-num\-versions[=\fR<NUM_VERSIONS>...]
.IP
detect and display the number of versions available (e.g. one, "1", version is available
if either a snapshot version exists, and is identical to live version, or only a live
version exists).  This option takes a value: "all" will print the filename and number of
versions, "single" will print only filenames which only have one version, (and
"single\-no\-snap" will print those without a snap taken, and "single\-with\-snap" will
print those with a snap taken), and "multiple" will print only filenames which only have
multiple versions. [possible values: all, single, single\-no\-snap, single\-with\-snap,
multiple]
.HP
\fB\-\-remote\-dir\fR <REMOTE_DIR>
.TP
DEPRECATED.
Use MAP_ALIASES. Manually specify that mount point for ZFS (directory which
.IP
contains a ".zfs" directory) or btrfs\-snapper (directory which contains a ".snapshots"
directory), such as the local mount point for a remote share.  You may also set via the
HTTM_REMOTE_DIR environment variable. [aliases: remote, snap\-point]
.HP
\fB\-\-local\-dir\fR <LOCAL_DIR>
.TP
DEPRECATED.
Use MAP_ALIASES.  Used with "remote\-dir" to determine where the
.TP
corresponding live root filesystem of the dataset is.
Put more simply, the "local\-dir"
.TP
is likely the directory you backup to your "remote\-dir".
If not set, httm defaults to
.TP
your current working directory.
You may also set via the environment variable
.IP
HTTM_LOCAL_DIR. [aliases: local]
.HP
\fB\-\-utc\fR
.IP
use UTC for date display and timestamps
.HP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
.IP
print configuration and debugging info
.HP
\fB\-\-install\-zsh\-hot\-keys\fR
.IP
install zsh hot keys to the users home directory, and then exit
.HP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Print help information
.HP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.IP
Print version information
