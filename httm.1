httm [OPTIONS] [\-\-] [INPUT_FILES]...
.SS "ARGS:"
.TP
<INPUT_FILES>...
\&...you should put your files here, if stdin(3) is not your jam.
.SS "OPTIONS:"
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-interactive\fR
use native dialogs for an interactive lookup session.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-select\fR
use native dialogs for an interactive lookup and file select.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-restore\fR
use native dialogs for an interactive restore from backup.
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-recursive\fR
recurse into selected directory to find more files. Only
available in interactive, select and restore modes.  WARNING:
Right now, this method blocks until the recursive search is
complete.  So, right now, only useful in directories with fewer
(several thousand?) files.
.TP
\fB\-\-snap\-point\fR <SNAP_POINT>
ordinarily httm will automatically choose your most local
snapshot directory, but here you may manually specify your own
mount point for that directory, such as the mount point for a
remote share.  You can also set via the environment variable
HTTM_SNAP_POINT.
.TP
\fB\-\-local\-dir\fR <LOCAL_DIR>
used with SNAP_POINT to determine where the corresponding live
root of the ZFS snapshot dataset is.  If not set, httm defaults
to your current working directory.  You can also set via the
environment variable HTTM_LOCAL_DIR.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
list the backup locations, without extraneous information,
delimited by a NEWLINE.
.TP
\fB\-0\fR, \fB\-\-zero\fR
list the backup locations, without extraneous information,
delimited by a NULL CHARACTER.
.TP
\fB\-\-not\-so\-pretty\fR
list the backup locations in a parseable format.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-live\fR

directories.
