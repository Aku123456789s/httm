.SH NAME
httm \- manual page for httm 0.11.2
.SH DESCRIPTION
httm 0.11.2
.PP
by default, httm will display non\-interactive information about unique file versions contained on
snapshots.
.PP
You may also select from the various interactive modes below to browse for, select, and/or restore
files.
.SS "USAGE:"
.IP
httm [OPTIONS] [INPUT_FILES]...
.SS "ARGS:"
.TP
<INPUT_FILES>...
in any non\-interactive mode, put requested files here.  If you enter no
files, then httm will pause waiting for input on stdin(3). In any
interactive mode, this is the directory search path. If no directory is
entered, httm will use the current working directory.
.SS "OPTIONS:"
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-interactive\fR
.IP
interactive browse and search a specified directory to display unique file versions.
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-select\fR
.IP
interactive browse and search a specified directory to display unique file versions.
Continue to another dialog to select a snapshot version to dump to stdout(3).
.HP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-restore\fR
.IP
interactive browse and search a specified directory to display unique file versions.
Continue to another dialog to select a snapshot version to restore.
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-deleted\fR <DELETED>
.TP
show deleted files in interactive modes.
In non\-interactive modes, do a search for all
.IP
files deleted from a specified directory. If "\-\-deleted only" is specified, then, in
interactive modes, non\-deleted files will be excluded from the search. If "\-\-deleted
single" is specified, then, deleted files behind deleted directories, (files with a
depth greater than one) will be ignored. [possible values: all, single, only]
.HP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-alt\-replicated\fR
.IP
automatically discover locally replicated datasets and list their snapshots as well.
NOTE: Be certain such replicated datasets are mounted before use, as httm will silently
ignore any unmounted datasets in the interactive modes.
.HP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-recursive\fR
.IP
recurse into selected directory to find more files. Only available in interactive and
deleted file modes.
.HP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-exact\fR
.IP
use exact pattern matching for searches in the interactive modes (in contrast to the
default fuzzy\-finder searching).
.HP
\fB\-\-snap\-point\fR <SNAP_POINT>
.IP
ordinarily httm will automatically choose your dataset root directory (most immediate
ancestor directory which contains ".zfs"), but here you may manually specify your own
mount point for that directory, such as the local mount point for a remote share.  You
can also set via the environment variable HTTM_SNAP_POINT.
.HP
\fB\-\-local\-dir\fR <LOCAL_DIR>
.IP
used with SNAP_POINT to determine where the corresponding live root filesystem of the
dataset is.  Put more simply, the LOCAL_DIR is the directory you backup to your
SNAP_POINT.  If not set, httm defaults to your current working directory.  You can also
set via the environment variable HTTM_LOCAL_DIR.
.HP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-fslayout\fR <FILESYSTEM_LAYOUT>
.IP
EXPERIMENTAL/UNSTABLE OPTION: Used to determine which filesystem layout to use
(btrfs\-snapper, btrfs\-timeshift, or zfs). Defaults to zfs.  For Timeshift users, use the
TIMESHIFT_HOME_DIR environment variable to set an alternate location for the Timeshift
home directory.  Otherwise httm will search the default directory,
"/run/timeshift/backup", for the path to "timeshift\-btrfs/snapshots". [possible values:
zfs, btrfs\-snapper, btrfs\-timeshift]
.HP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
.IP
display the backup locations only, without extraneous information, delimited by a
NEWLINE.
.HP
\fB\-0\fR, \fB\-\-zero\fR
.IP
display the backup locations only, without extraneous information, delimited by a NULL
CHARACTER.
.HP
\fB\-\-not\-so\-pretty\fR
.IP
display the ordinary output, but tab delimited, without any pretty border lines.
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-live\fR
.IP
only display information concerning snapshot versions, and no 'live' versions of files
or directories.
.HP
\fB\-\-install\-zsh\-hot\-keys\fR
.IP
install zsh hot keys to the users home directory, and then exit
.HP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Print help information
.HP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.IP
Print version information
