.SH NAME
httm \- manual page for httm 0.12.11
.SH DESCRIPTION
httm 0.12.11
httm prints the size, date and corresponding locations of available unique versions of files
residing on snapshots.  May also be used interactively to select and restore from such versions, and
even to snapshot datasets which contain certain files.
.SS "USAGE:"
.IP
httm [OPTIONS] [\-\-] [INPUT_FILES]...
.SS "ARGS:"
.TP
<INPUT_FILES>...
in any non\-interactive mode, put requested files here.  If you enter no
files, then httm will pause waiting for input on stdin(3). In any
interactive mode, this is the directory search path. If no directory is
entered, httm will use the current working directory.
.SS "OPTIONS:"
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-interactive\fR
.IP
interactive browse and search a specified directory to display unique file versions.
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-select\fR
.IP
interactive browse and search a specified directory to display unique file versions.
Continue to another dialog to select a snapshot version to dump to stdout(3).
.HP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-restore[=\fR<RESTORE>...]
.IP
interactive browse and search a specified directory to display unique file versions.
Continue to another dialog to select a snapshot version to restore.  Default is a
non\-destructive "copy" to the current working directory with a new name, so as not to
overwrite any "live" file version.  However, user may specify "overwrite" to restore to
the same file location. [possible values: copy, overwrite, yolo]
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-deleted[=\fR<DELETED_MODE>...]
.TP
show deleted files in interactive modes.
In non\-interactive modes, do a search for all
.IP
files deleted from a specified directory. If "\-\-deleted only" is specified, then, in
interactive modes, non\-deleted files will be excluded from the search. If "\-\-deleted
single" is specified, then, deleted files behind deleted directories, (files with a
depth greater than one) will be ignored. [possible values: all, single, only]
.HP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-alt\-replicated\fR
.IP
automatically discover locally replicated datasets and list their snapshots as well.
NOTE: Be certain such replicated datasets are mounted before use.  httm will silently
ignore unmounted datasets in the interactive modes.
.HP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-recursive\fR
.IP
recurse into the selected directory to find more files. Only available in interactive
and deleted file modes.
.HP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-exact\fR
.IP
use exact pattern matching for searches in the interactive modes (in contrast to the
default fuzzy\-finder searching).
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-snap\fR
.IP
snapshot the mount point/s of the dataset/s which contains the input file/s. Note: This
is a ZFS only option. [aliases: snap\-file, snapshot, snap\-file\-mount]
.HP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-mount\-for\-file\fR
.IP
display the mount point/s of the dataset/s which contains the input file/s. [aliases:
mount]
.HP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-last\-snap[=\fR<LAST_SNAP>...]
.IP
automatically select and print the path of last\-in\-time unique snapshot version for the
input file.  May also be used as a shortcut to restore from such last version when used
with the "\-\-restore", or "\-r", flag.  Default is to return the absolute last\-in\-time but
user may also request the last unique file version relative to the "live" version by
appending "relative" to the flag. [possible values: abs, absolute, rel, relative]
.HP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
.IP
display the snapshot locations only, without extraneous information, delimited by a
NEWLINE character. [aliases: newline]
.HP
\fB\-0\fR, \fB\-\-zero\fR
.IP
display the snapshot locations only, without extraneous information, delimited by a NULL
character.
.HP
\fB\-\-not\-so\-pretty\fR
.IP
display the ordinary output, but tab delimited, without any pretty border lines.
[aliases: tabs, plain\-jane]
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-live\fR
.IP
only display information concerning snapshot versions (display no information regarding
\&'live' versions of files or directories). [aliases: dead, disco]
.HP
\fB\-\-remote\-dir\fR <REMOTE_DIR>
.IP
ordinarily httm will automatically choose your dataset root directory (the most
proximate ancestor directory which contains a snapshot directory), but here you may
manually specify that mount point for ZFS (directory which contains a ".zfs" directory)
or btrfs\-snapper (directory which contains a ".snapshots" directory), such as the local
mount point for a remote share.  You may also set via the HTTM_REMOTE_DIR environment
variable.  Note: Use of both "remote" and "local" are not always necessary to view
versions on remote shares.  These options *are necessary* if you want to view snapshot
versions from within the local directory you back up to your remote share, however, httm
can also automatically detect ZFS and btrfs\-snapper datasets mounted as AFP, SMB, and
NFS remote shares, if you browse that remote share where it is locally mounted.
[aliases: remote, snap\-point]
.HP
\fB\-\-local\-dir\fR <LOCAL_DIR>
.IP
used with "remote" to determine where the corresponding live root filesystem of the
dataset is.  Put more simply, the "local" is the directory you backup to your "remote".
If not set, httm defaults to your current working directory.  You may also set via the
environment variable HTTM_LOCAL_DIR. [aliases: local]
.HP
\fB\-\-install\-zsh\-hot\-keys\fR
.IP
install zsh hot keys to the users home directory, and then exit
.HP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Print help information
.HP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.IP
Print version information
