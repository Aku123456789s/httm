.SH NAME
httm \- manual page for httm 0.19.9
.SH DESCRIPTION
httm 0.19.9
httm prints the size, date and corresponding locations of available unique versions of files
residing on snapshots.  May also be used interactively to select and restore from such versions, and
even to snapshot datasets which contain certain files.
.SS "USAGE:"
.IP
httm [OPTIONS] [\-\-] [INPUT_FILES]...
.SS "ARGS:"
.TP
<INPUT_FILES>...
in any non\-interactive mode, put requested files here.  If you enter no
files, then httm will pause waiting for input on stdin.  In any
interactive mode, this is the directory search path. If no directory is
entered, httm will use the current working directory.
.SS "OPTIONS:"
.HP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-browse\fR
.IP
interactive browse and search a specified directory to display unique file versions.
[aliases: interactive]
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-select\fR
.IP
interactive browse and search a specified directory to display unique file versions.
Continue to another dialog to select a snapshot version to dump to stdout.
.HP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-restore[=\fR<RESTORE>...]
.IP
interactive browse and search a specified directory to display unique file versions.
Continue to another dialog to select a snapshot version to restore.  This argument
optionally takes a value.  Default behavior/value is a non\-destructive "copy" to the
current working directory with a new name, so as not to overwrite any "live" file
version.  However, the user may specify "overwrite" or ("yolo") to restore to the same
file location.  Note, "overwrite" can be a DESTRUCTIVE operation.  Overwrite mode will
attempt to preserve attributes, like the permissions/mode, timestamps, xattrs and
ownership of the selected snapshot file version (this is and will likely remain a UNIX
only feature).  In order to preserve such attributes in "copy" mode, specify the
"copy\-and\-preserve" value. [possible values: copy, copy\-and\-preserve, overwrite, yolo]
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-deleted[=\fR<DELETED_MODE>...]
.TP
show deleted files in interactive modes.
In non\-interactive modes, do a search for all
.TP
files deleted from a specified directory. This argument optionally takes a value.
The
.TP
default behavior/value is "all".
If "only" is specified, then, in the interactive
.IP
modes, non\-deleted files will be excluded from the search. If "single" is specified,
then, deleted files behind deleted directories, (that is \fB\-\-\fR files with a depth greater
than one) will be ignored. [possible values: all, single, only]
.HP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-alt\-replicated\fR
.IP
automatically discover locally replicated datasets and list their snapshots as well.
NOTE: Be certain such replicated datasets are mounted before use.  httm will silently
ignore unmounted datasets in the interactive modes.
.HP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-recursive\fR
.IP
recurse into the selected directory to find more files. Only available in interactive
and deleted file modes.
.HP
\fB\-\-preview[=\fR<PREVIEW>...]
.TP
user may specify a command to preview snapshots while in select view.
This argument
.TP
optionally takes a value specifying the command to be executed.
The default
.TP
value/command, if no command value specified, is a 'bowie' formatted 'diff'.
User
.IP
defined commands must specify the snapshot file name "{snap_file}" and the live file
name "{live_file}" within their shell command.
.HP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-exact\fR
.IP
use exact pattern matching for searches in the interactive modes (in contrast to the
default fuzzy searching).
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-snap[=\fR<SNAP_FILE_MOUNT>...]
.TP
snapshot a file/s most immediate mount.
This argument optionally takes a value for a
.TP
snapshot suffix.
The default suffix is 'httmSnapFileMount'.  Note: This is a ZFS only
.IP
option. [aliases: snap\-file, snapshot, snap\-file\-mount]
.HP
\fB\-\-prune[=\fR<PRUNE_FILE>...]
.IP
prune all snapshot/s which contain the input file/s on that file's most immediate mount
(via "zfs destroy").  "zfs destroy" is a DESTRUCTIVE operation which *does not* strictly
apply to the file in question, but the entire dataset.  Careless use may cause you to
lose snapshot data you care about.  This argument optionally takes a value to filter
only those snapshots which contain the specified pattern (multiple values are separated
by a comma).  The value "native" will restrict selection to only httm native snapshot
suffix values, like "httmSnapFileMount" and "ounceSnapFileMount".  Note: This is a ZFS
only option.
.HP
\fB\-\-snaps\-for\-file\fR
.IP
display all snapshots names for a file on that file's most immediate mount.
.HP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-mount\-for\-file\fR
.IP
display the all mount point/s of all dataset/s which contain/s the input file/s.
[aliases: mount]
.HP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-last\-snap[=\fR<LAST_SNAP>...]
.IP
automatically select and print the path of last\-in\-time unique snapshot version for the
input file.  This argument optionally takes a value.  Possible values are: "any", return
the last in time snapshot version, this is the default behavior/value, "ditto", return
only last snaps which are the same as the live file version, "no\-ditto\-exclusive",
return only a last snap which is not the same as the live version (argument
"\-\-not\-ditto" is an alias for this option), "no\-ditto\-inclusive", return a last snap
which is not the same as the live version, or should non\-exist, return the live file,
and, "none" or "without", return the live file only for those files without a last
snapshot. [possible values: any, ditto, no\-ditto, no\-ditto\-exclusive,
no\-ditto\-inclusive, none, without]
.HP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
.IP
display the snapshot locations only, without extraneous information, delimited by a
NEWLINE character. [aliases: newline]
.HP
\fB\-0\fR, \fB\-\-zero\fR
.IP
display the snapshot locations only, without extraneous information, delimited by a NULL
character.
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-filter\fR
.IP
by default, in the interactive modes, httm will filter out files residing upon
non\-supported datasets (like ext4, tmpfs, procfs, sysfs, or devtmpfs, etc.), and within
any "common" snapshot paths.  Here, one may select to disable such filtering.  httm,
however, will always show the input path, and results from behind any input path when
that is the path being searched.
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-hidden\fR
.IP
never show information regarding hidden files and directories (those that start with a
\&'.') in the recursive or interactive modes.
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-traverse\fR
.TP
in recursive mode, don't traverse symlinks.
Although httm does its best to prevent
.IP
searching pathologically recursive symlink\-ed paths, here, you may disable symlink
traversal completely.  NOTE: httm will never traverse symlinks when a requested
recursive search is on the root/base directory ("/").
.HP
\fB\-\-not\-so\-pretty\fR
.IP
display the ordinary output, but tab delimited, without any pretty border lines.
[aliases: tabs, plain\-jane]
.HP
\fB\-\-omit\-ditto\fR
.IP
omit display of the snapshot version which may be identical to the live version (`httm`
ordinarily displays all snapshot versions and the live version).
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-live\fR
.IP
only display information concerning snapshot versions (display no information regarding
live versions of files or directories). [aliases: dead, disco]
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-snap\fR
.IP
only display information concerning 'pseudo\-live' versions in Display Recursive mode (in
\fB\-\-deleted\fR, \fB\-\-recursive\fR, but non\-interactive modes).  Useful for finding the "files that
once were" and displaying only those pseudo\-live/zombie files. [aliases: undead, zombie]
.HP
\fB\-\-map\-aliases\fR <MAP_ALIASES>
.IP
manually map a local directory (eg. "/Users/<User Name>") as an alias of a mount point
for ZFS or btrfs, such as the local mount point for a backup on a remote share (eg.
"/Volumes/Home").  This option is useful if you wish to view snapshot versions from
within the local directory you back up to your remote share.  This option requires a
value.  Such a value is delimited by a colon, ':', and is specified in the form
<LOCAL_DIR>:<REMOTE_DIR> (eg. \fB\-\-map\-aliases\fR /Users/<User Name>:/Volumes/Home).  Multiple
maps may be specified delimited by a comma, ','.  You may also set via the environment
variable HTTM_MAP_ALIASES. [aliases: aliases]
.HP
\fB\-\-num\-versions[=\fR<NUM_VERSIONS>...]
.IP
detect and display the number of versions available (e.g. one, "1", version is available
if either a snapshot version exists, and is identical to live version, or only a live
version exists).  This argument optionally takes a value.  The default value, "all",
will print the filename and number of versions, "single" will print only filenames which
only have one version, (and "single\-no\-snap" will print those without a snap taken, and
"single\-with\-snap" will print those with a snap taken), and "multiple" will print only
filenames which only have multiple versions. [possible values: all, single,
single\-no\-snap, single\-with\-snap, multiple]
.HP
\fB\-\-utc\fR
.IP
use UTC for date display and timestamps
.HP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
.IP
print configuration and debugging info
.HP
\fB\-\-install\-zsh\-hot\-keys\fR
.IP
install zsh hot keys to the users home directory, and then exit
.HP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Print help information
.HP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.IP
Print version information
